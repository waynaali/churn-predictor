## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **building predictive models** on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

**Goals:**

* Understand customer behavior patterns
* Identify factors contributing to churn
* Build machine learning models to predict churn
* Discover high-risk customer groups
* Prepare actionable business insights

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
* **Total Customers:** 7,043
* **Total Features:** 21
* **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

⚠️ Note: The dataset file (`customer_data.csv`) is not included in this repository.
Please download it from Kaggle and place it in the project folder before running the notebooks.

## 🔍 Key Insights

**Week 1: EDA**

* Customers with **month-to-month contracts** have significantly higher churn rates.
* Customers with **short tenure (< 6 months)** are more likely to churn.
* Higher **Monthly Charges** are associated with increased churn.
* **Fiber optic internet users** show higher churn compared to DSL users.
* Customers using **electronic check payment method** have higher churn rates.

**Week 2: ML Models**

* Trained and compared **three machine learning models**:

  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Decision Tree Classifier
  3. Random Forest Classifier
* Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix**
* Conducted **feature engineering** with new features:

  * `TotalRevenue` = tenure × monthly charges
  * `TotalServices` = count of active services
  * `TenureGroup` = binned tenure
  * `HighCharges` = flag for high monthly charges
* Retrained the best model (Random Forest) with new features
* Observed improvement in prediction accuracy after feature engineering

**Typical Model Accuracy (Expected Ranges):**

| Model               | Accuracy Range |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 75–80%         |
| Decision Tree       | 72–78%         |
| Random Forest       | 78–83%         |

**Top Important Features (Typical):**

1. Contract type (month-to-month indicator)
2. Tenure (how long customer has been with company)
3. Monthly Charges
4. Internet Service type
5. Payment Method
