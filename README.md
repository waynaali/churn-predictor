## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, building **machine learning models**, and applying **model optimization techniques** on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

**Goals:**

* Understand customer behavior patterns
* Identify factors contributing to churn
* Build predictive models to classify churn
* Optimize model performance
* Generate actionable business insights

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
* **Total Customers:** 7,043
* **Total Features:** 21
* **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

⚠️ Note: The dataset file (`customer_data.csv`) is not included in this repository.
Please download it from Kaggle and place it in the project folder before running the notebooks.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### **Week 1: EDA**

* Month-to-month contract customers show highest churn
* Short tenure customers (< 6 months) are high-risk
* Higher Monthly Charges → higher churn probability
* Fiber optic users churn more than DSL users
* Electronic check users have higher churn

---

### **Week 2: ML Models**

* Models trained:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest

* Feature engineering:

  * `TotalRevenue`
  * `TotalServices`
  * `TenureGroup`
  * `HighCharges`

* Random Forest performed best among baseline models

---

### **Week 3: Model Optimization**

* Applied **hyperparameter tuning** (Grid Search / Random Search)
* Used **cross-validation** for reliable evaluation
* Optimized models:

  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost

**Results:**

| Model             | Accuracy |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Baseline RF       | ~82%     |
| Optimized RF      | ~86%     |
| Optimized XGBoost | ~88–89%  |

✅ **Best Model:** Optimized XGBoost
✅ Achieved **85%+ accuracy target**
